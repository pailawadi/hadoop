How to move data to Hive table from MySql 
When running hive in a cluster , there will be a directory in hdfs  /user/hive/warehouse where all hive data is stored in hdfs
Hive uses mapreduce as processing engine and hdfs as storage

To Start hive type hive in command line:
hive >  dfs -ls /user/hive/warehouse
hive > dfs -ls /user/hive/warehouse

> create database sqoop_import

output :drwxrwxrwx   - cloudera supergroup          0 2016-11-16 13:22 /user/hive/warehouse/sqoop_import.db
.db stands for database
